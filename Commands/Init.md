# git init

The `git init` command is used to create an empty git repository.

If you wanted to create a directory and initialize a git repository, you van so do with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd Newdirectory
git init
```
Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as 
[status](./Status.md),
[add](./Add.md),
[commit](./Commit.md)
and more.

Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all conetnt including other directories.
